# Conclusions of Findings

The analysis reveals a **continuous increase in monthly loan payments from June 2019 to late 2012**, followed by a subsequent decrease from late 2012 to early 2013. Post this decline, **payments witnessed a significant rise from 25,000 to 180,000 between 2013 and 2014, followed by another decline.**

The study underscores the evolution of the company's loan terms, noting the introduction of 12-month and 60-month terms in 2010 alongside the initial 36-month term. Interestingly, there's been a consistent increase in monthly loan payments since the inception of the 12-month term, persisting until 2013. The 36-month term has also seen steady payment increments from 2009 to the present. Conversely, the 60-month term initially experienced a 100k dollar drop in monthly loan payments shortly after its 2012 debut but has since exhibited a gradual upward trend, with current monthly payments hovering around 350k dollars.

Furthermore, the ProsperRating and IsBorrowerHomeowner attributes reveal a significant proportion of C-rated borrowers, with a fairly even split between homeowners and non-homeowners. A-rated borrowers are more prevalent, with a higher homeownership percentage. In contrast, AA-rated borrowers are relatively scarce, with the majority being homeowners.

The analysis **summarizes Borrower APR and maximum loan amounts across various Prosper ratings.** A-rated borrowers generally exhibit lower Borrower APR and higher loan amounts, while AA-rated borrowers have the lowest APR and a maximum loan limit of $25,000. Borrower APR for B and C-rated borrowers ranges from 0.07 to 0.3, with a maximum loan cap of $25,000. However, D-rated borrowers experience higher Borrower APR compared to other ratings. E and HR-rated borrowers have the highest Borrower APR and the lowest maximum monthly income, with HR borrowers also carrying a high debt-to-income ratio.
